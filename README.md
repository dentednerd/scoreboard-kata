# updateScoreboard

The challenge is to implement a function that updates a scoreboard every time someone wins a point in a game. The scoreboard is an object with any number of players. When `updateScoreboard` is called with a board and the name of a player, that player's score is incremented by one and the updated scoreboard is returned.
